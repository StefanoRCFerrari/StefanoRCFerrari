"Clarke calculator". It was a graphical calculator that simplified calculations for solving problems in electrical power transmission lines.

Mary Keller (1913–1985): Sister Mary Keller broke barriers in computer science, becoming the first woman to earn a Ph.D. in the field. She co-developed BASIC,
a beginner-friendly programming language that opened doors for countless learners.
As an advocate for women in STEM, she encouraged working mothers to bring their babies to class—a progressive stance for the time

Hedy Lamarr (1914–2000): A Hollywood actress and inventor, Lamarr co-patented a frequency-hopping communication system during World War II with composer George Antheil.
This technology was designed to create an un-jammable torpedo guidance system and became a precursor to modern Wi-Fi, GPS, and Bluetooth.

Grace Hopper (1906–1992): This U.S. Navy Rear Admiral was a computer scientist who helped program the Mark I computer during World War II.
Her key innovations include developing the first compiler, a program that translates written instructions into computer code, and leading the creation of COBOL,
an early business-friendly programming language.

Jean Bartik (1924 - 2011): Jean Bartik was a groundbreaking computer programmer who made significant contributions to the early development of electronic computers.
During World War II, she was one of six women recruited by the University of Pennsylvania’s Moore School of Electrical Engineering to work as “computers.”
Bartik and her colleagues programmed the ENIAC, one of the world’s first electronic computers.
Their work involved developing complex mathematical calculations and wiring diagrams to enable the ENIAC to perform various tasks, such as calculating military artillery trajectories.
Bartik’s work on the ENIAC played a pivotal role in shaping the future of computing and programming.
Her contributions demonstrated the potential of electronic computers to solve complex problems efficiently and laid the foundation for modern computing.

Elizabeth Feinler (1931–present): Elizabeth Feinler’s team at the Stanford Research Institute managed early internet directories.
Her work on transitioning to the Domain Name System (DNS) introduced the familiar “.com,” “.org,” and “.gov” protocols.
Her contributions are foundational to the internet as we know it today.

Karen Spärck Jones (1935–2007): Karen Spärck Jones laid the foundation for modern search engines with her work on Inverse Document Frequency (IDF),
a method still used today to rank search results. Her contributions to natural language processing and information retrieval systems revolutionised how we access information online.

Katherine Johnson (1918–2020): A brilliant mathematician at NASA, Johnson performed complex orbital calculations by hand, verifying the results of early computers.
Her work was critical to the success of the first U.S. manned spaceflights and the Apollo 11 mission to the moon. 

Annie Easley (1933–2011): Annie Easley attended Xavier University where she majored in pharmacy for around 2 years. She then began her career at NACA (later NASA) as one of only four
African American employees at the time. She worked on code that contributed to energy-efficient batteries and space technology.
Easley actively encouraged more women and African Americans to enter STEM fields, inspiring countless individuals to pursue tech careers.

Ruzena Bajcsy (1933–present): The illustrious computer scientist Ruzena Bajcsy stands as a beacon of brilliance in the realms of robotics, artificial intelligence, and computer vision.
